# Chess Game ‚ôüÔ∏è <sup><sub>[DEMO](https://imba-chess.web.app/)</sub></sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chess Game developed using Imba (version one). It's not complete, but it already has a lot of features that a real chess game must have. It was very fun to code this and I learned a lot about Imba language and about programming logic itself. I hope to someday finish it.

### How to run

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy the code below into your terminal and enjoy:
```
git clone https://github.com/LucasSFranco/imba-chess
cd imba-chess
npm i
npm run dev
```
